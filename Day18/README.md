- Draws a grid of randomly colored dots.
- Demonstrates the use of loops and turtle movement.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- Python `turtle` module
- RGB color manipulation
- For loops and nested loops
- Random selection with `random.choice()`
- Using external libraries (`colorgram` for color extraction)
