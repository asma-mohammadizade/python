# â˜• Coffee Machine

A Python console program that simulates a coffee machine. Users can order drinks, insert coins, and get reports on inventory and profit. The machine supports three types of coffee: espresso, latte, and cappuccino.

## ðŸ“Œ What It Does

- Offers three drink options with different ingredient requirements and costs.
- Accepts coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies) and calculates total inserted.
- Checks for sufficient resources and processes transactions.
- Dispenses the drink and deducts resources from the inventory.
- Provides a "report" command to display remaining resources and total profit.
- Allows turning the machine off with an "off" command.

## ðŸ§  Concepts Covered

- Dictionaries for menu and resources
- Functions for modular logic
- Loops and user input
- Arithmetic for coin handling
- Conditionals for inventory and transaction logic
