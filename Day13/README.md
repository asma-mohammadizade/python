# 🐞 Day 13 – Debugging Practice

This day focuses on identifying and fixing common Python bugs through hands-on examples. Rather than building a complete project, the challenge helps improve your ability to debug broken code and understand Python error messages.

## 📌 What It Covers

- Syntax errors (e.g., missing colons or incorrect indentation)
- Logic errors (e.g., incorrect comparisons or loop conditions)
- Runtime errors (e.g., index out of range, type errors)
- Using Python debugging techniques:
  - `print()` statements
  - Stepping through code mentally
  - Isolating logic into testable chunks

## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- Loop iteration and logic
- Index handling in lists
- Conditional execution
- Variable scope and reassignments
- Understanding and interpreting tracebacks
